# Verkkokauppa using Django

### Description

A simple verkkokauppa made in Django, using Vue.js/Vuex, AJAX and a background API and Bulma .css framework. This project was done as part of a job interview for FNS.
The project was almost entirely written by hand and designed from the ground up to incorporate best practices. The design works on mobile devices also.

Time taken: Approx 5Â½ hours incl. testing, diagrams, readme explanation, deploying and modifying for production server, payment integration, security and setting up domain and SSL etc.

### FAQ

Q: What technologies did you use?

A: *Quite a few by the end...*

* Python/Django for the backend
* Vue.js for ajax and the cart logic
* Vuex to store the quantity of items in the cart (outside of a variable)
* Bulma to handle the .css and some forms
* JSonResponse as a serializer to convert data to json and MariaDB (HeidiSQL frontend) to handle the database
* Unraid (Slackware) to test the first deployment in a Debian VM with LetsEncrypt and DyDNS (reverse proxy)
* Linode to host the project
* ufw, and SSL (Certbot) for security
* Nginx for handling images etc. and Gunicorn for serving the webpage
* Stripe handles the payment and currency conversion via their API

Q: Why did you use Vue.js and not React or Angular?
A: It plays nicer with Django, allows building business logic into the verkkokauppa from the beginning and scales far more easily for business related projects anyway.
I'm far faster at splitting sites into reusable components with Vue.js and it means I don't have to waste literally hours of my life updating each page manually. I've started using Vue.js for anything I used React for earlier. FWIW: I've barely touched Angular and its global interest has been decreasing for some time anyway.

Q: Why did you use Bulma for CSS?

A: Because everyone should be using it. I'm not much of a frontend person, so if I can let Bulma take care of that then all the better.

Q: Why did you use MariaDB?

A: I'm not much of a fan of Oracle's software and HeidiSQL has a dark theme.

Q: Why did you use Stripe for payment, and why doesn't it work when I build the source code?

A: I used it because Stripe is amazing. It doesn't work because you need to make your own account and use your own keys.
Ensure that you have at the minimum, a test business name and add your keys in the settings.py and secrets.py where directed.

Q: How did you do the "design?"

A: Most pages are just a simple bootstrap. Work was obviously focused elsewhere. I added all the containers, elements and so on and set up the logic for the data that moves between them (aka, the backend). It looks simple because it should be. Anywhere I didn't have to reinvent the wheel, I didn't.

Q: Why did you leave all the console.log()/print() statements in?

A: There's not that many, and because it's meant to be a project to show how I code and how I solve problems and test functions. You can quickly remove evey occurance with any half-decent text editor or IDE.

Q: Text fields on the cart.html page are kinda ugly bruh

A: Yeah I was going to use PrettierForms to in the end but I had already well and truly completed all the necessary assignment tasks and what can I say, I don't work for free. :) I'll most likely update them in the future because it's just a simple thing to add.

Q: Can I use your source to continue building my own site?

A: Of course.

Q: Could I charge people for this?

A: Check the LICENSE.md

### Improvements I'd make if I did this project again
1. Auto generate random int for each new product ID
2. User accounts and reviews
3. Email user order confirmation
4. PDF Receipts
5. Prettier front-end

## Local machine installation instructions

1. Ensure Python3 and pip are installed (I use a venv in PyCharm)
2. Run ```python pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run ```python manage.py makemigrations```
4. Run ```python manage.py migrate```
5. Create a superuser to access admin page and add products to site ```python manage.py createsuperuser```
6. Start the app ```python manage.py runserver```

Open a browser and visit http://localhost:8000/

### Database

This application is set up to use a MySQL/MariaDB server, and a database called "verkkokauppa" running on the same machine. NOT sqlite3
______________________________________

To change the database back to sqlite3 change the DATABASES array in verkkokauppa/settings.py to:

```DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}
```

Then repeat above steps 3 and 4.
Project is then storing database data inside an sqlite3 file in the root directory

Open a browser and visit http://localhost:8000/
